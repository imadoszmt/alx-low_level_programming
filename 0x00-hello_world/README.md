#Hello, Word#

This project is part of Alx-Holberton software engineering program, aims to illustrate the compilation process of ##C files## using [gcc] compiler.

##Script files##


0-preprocessor: a script that runs a C file named stored in $CFILE variable through the preprocessor and save the output in the file named c. 

1-compiler: a script that compiles a C file stored in $CFILE but does not link. The output file will named same as the C file, but with extension .o (object file) instead of .c .

2-assembler: a script that generates the assembly code of a C code of a file stored in $CFILE variable and save it in an output file.The output file has the same name as as the C file with the extension .s (Assembly file) instead of .c (C file).

3-name: a script that compiles a C file stored in $CFILE variable and creates an executable named 'cisfun'.

4-puts.c: C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line. Using 'puts' function and returning value of 0.

5-printf.c: a C program that prints exactly "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,"using 'printf' function, followed by a new line and return 0.
